# Memristors

This is an implementation of the basic Strukov's TiO2 memristor. The goal is to understand if we can simulate neural networks with the ones made of memristors. In particular I seek for answers for the following questions: what network architectures are useful, what is the minimal complexity of network node, what kind signals should we use etc.

Current backlog is:
1. Integration of equation of the state of memristors instead of approximation
2. Add more models
3. Speed improvement and bugs elimination
4. Add GUI to control simulation
5.
