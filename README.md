# Memristors

This is my current implementation of the basic Strukov's TiO2 memristor. The goal is to understand if we can simulate neural networks with memristor ones. In particular here are open questions: what neural network architectures are useful, what is the minimal node complexity, what signals should we use etc. I beleive some day it will be useful.

Current backlog is:
1. Integration of equation of the state of memristors instead of approximation
2. Add more models
3. Speed improvement and bugs elimination
4. Add GUI to control simulation
5.
